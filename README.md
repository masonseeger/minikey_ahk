# minikey_ahk
Repository for auto hot key mapping for personal 12 key mini keyboard.

Mapped the keys on the board to ctrl+alt+(number keys 1-0 and - and =) This was done to best avoid common commands that might be overheard by regular windows programs.

Current additions sets a very simple base template for all of the commands.
